# Design and Simulation of series resonant converter in MATLAB|Project|
– Specifications: <=5% THD, output load voltage of 50V rms at 1kHz for 10 ohm resistive load
– To Obtained converter parameters L & C values from given data with some assumption.
– 5.37% of THD was obtained from software result which was closer to 5% as per requirement.
